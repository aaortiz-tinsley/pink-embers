# pink-embers
A p5.js particle system that gives the appearance of pink embers floating from an off-screen fire.

This simple exercise was completed as fun practice with arrays and objects. 

I found a neat 'how-to' on Youtube called "Particles Effect With P5.js," by Traversy Media. I followed along, adjusted the code to make it my own, and got inspired somewhere along the way to create an effect that gives the appearance of embers floating up from a flame. I decided to go with the bubblegum pink background (because duh, pink! let's just say these embers came from somewhere/something mystical) and brought the pale-blue particle circles down in opacity to achieve that interesting glistening effect.
